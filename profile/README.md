## Native Module Federation

### What is Native Module Federation

<b>Native Module Federation</b> is a modern approach to building modular and independently deployable JavaScript applications using native browser features—specifically import maps and ESM (ECMAScript Modules).

It allows JavaScript assets—such as micro frontends or individual app components—to be developed, tested, and deployed independently. These assets are then fetched remotely and integrated at runtime using the browser’s native ESM capabilities, without relying on a bundler like Webpack to stitch them together.
